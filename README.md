# Statistical Learning Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments given in the statistical learning course, which covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Course Description
The course provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding and evaluating statistical learning techniques. It covers classical and state-of-the-art supervised learning methods such as linear regression, regularized regression (Ridge, Lasso, and other L1-methods), naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, splines, random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning. The course also discusses model selection techniques, including various forms of cross-validation and permutation tests.

Additionally, the course covers unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering methods (k-means and more advanced methods) and dimension reduction methods (PCA, ICA, etc.).
