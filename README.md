# Statistical Learning Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments given in the statistical learning course, which covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Course Description
The course provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding and evaluating statistical learning techniques. It covers classical and state-of-the-art supervised learning methods such as linear regression, regularized regression (Ridge, Lasso, and other L1-methods), naive Bayes, decision trees, logistic regression, splines, random forests, support vector machines, and deep learning. The course also discusses model selection techniques, including various forms of cross-validation and permutation tests.

Additionally, the course covers unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering methods (k-means and more advanced methods) and dimension reduction methods (PCA, ICA, etc.). 

## Assignments
1. [Assignment 1]([link](https://github.com/n0rdp0l/Statistical_Learning/tree/main/Assignment_1)): The main essence of the assignment is to compare the performance of K-nearest neighbors analysis and logistic regression with a lasso penalty on predicting the target variable Y using different sets of predictors. The first part involves considering Y and 3 relevant and 3 irrelevant predictors, while the second part involves considering Y and all 203 predictors. The third and fourth parts involve applying K-nearest neighbor analysis and logistic regression with a lasso penalty on both sets of predictors and comparing their results. The second part of the assignment involves unsupervised learning, where the students will use the Coping dataset to perform clustering analysis using different techniques.
